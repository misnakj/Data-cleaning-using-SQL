# data_cleaning_sql

This project encompasses the application of SQL for data cleaning and was successfully executed as part of the Data Camp course under the guidance of instructor AlexTheAnalyst.Throughout this endeavor, I actively engaged with the Nashville Housing Dataâ€”a comprehensive dataset providing statistical insights into land use and properties within Nashville, the capital city of the U.S. state of Tennessee.

      My responsibilities in this project spanned the implementation of rigorous data standardization techniques, meticulous handling of null values, strategic utilization of joins and substrings, and adept resolution of issues related to duplicates and redundant columns. This comprehensive approach resulted in a thorough and effective data cleaning process, significantly enhancing the overall quality and integrity of the dataset.
